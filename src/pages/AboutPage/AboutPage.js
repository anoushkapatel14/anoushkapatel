          Hey there! I'm a recent graduate of the Software Engineering bootcamp
          at BrainStation. Picture this: I've traded in my conductor's baton for
          a keyboard and mouse, making the jump from Director of Music to coding
          maestro!
        </p>

        <p>
          My career pivot showcases adaptability and a love for lifelong
          learning. As a past teacher, my forte lies in soft skills:
          communication, teamwork, and problem-solving.
        </p>

        <p>
          My mission? To merge my diverse background with software engineering.
          I'm eager to collaborate on innovative projects, add value to teams,
          and infuse a touch of creativity into tech solutions. Let's turn code
          into a symphony of success! ðŸš€ðŸŽ‰
